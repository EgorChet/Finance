# Deploy with password protection

Your real spending data never ships in the Vue build. It lives in **Supabase** and is only returned by the **API after password login**.

Anyone can open the public site URL, but without the password they only get **Try demo** (fake sample data).

You and your wife share the same password — both sign in on any device.

**Pre-flight:** from the repo root run `node scripts/deploy-check.mjs`

## Step 0 — GitHub repo

This folder is not on GitHub until you push it:

```bash
cd /path/to/Finance
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Create a private repo on github.com, then:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USER/Finance.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Use a **private** repo if `data/` was ever committed in the past.

---

## Architecture

| Piece | Host | Public? | Holds real data? |
|-------|------|---------|------------------|
| Vue app | GitHub Pages | Yes (UI only) | No |
| Node API | Render | Yes (endpoints) | No — reads Supabase |
| Python analyzer | Render | Internal | No |
| JSON database | Supabase | No (service key only) | **Yes** |

---

## Step 1 — Supabase (free)

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. **SQL Editor** → run `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. **Settings → API** → copy:
   - Project URL → `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `service_role` key → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (never put this in the frontend or git).

4. Seed your local data once (from your Mac):

```bash
cd /path/to/Finance
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ... \
node scripts/seed-supabase.mjs
```

Re-run after big local changes if you want production to match.

---

## Step 2 — Render (free)

1. Push this repo to **GitHub** (use a **private** repo if `data/` was ever committed).
2. [render.com](https://render.com) → **New Blueprint** → connect repo → apply `render.yaml`.
3. Set these env vars on **finance-api** (Render dashboard):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|--------|
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | Shared family password (you + wife) |
| `AUTH_LABELS` | Login names, comma-separated — e.g. two household names (required for sign-in) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Long random string (Render can auto-generate) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | From Supabase |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | From Supabase |
| `STORAGE` | `supabase` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Your GitHub Pages origin only, e.g. `https://YOUR_USER.github.io` (no path, no trailing slash) |
| `CAL_SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Long random string (Render can auto-generate). Encrypts persisted Cal browser session in Supabase. **Keep stable** — changing it invalidates the saved session (one extra SMS login). |

4. Wait for both services (API + analyzer) to go green.
5. Copy the API URL, e.g. `https://finance-api-xxxx.onrender.com`.

**Verify API ↔ analyzer link** (no login needed):

```bash
curl "https://YOUR_API.onrender.com/health?deep=1"
```

You want:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "analyzer": true, "analyzer_env_set": true, "analyzer_uses_public_url": true }
```

If `analyzer_env_set` is **false** → set `ANALYZER_URL` on finance-api (see below).

If `analyzer` is **false** → analyzer is asleep or `ANALYZER_URL` is wrong. See troubleshooting.

### `ANALYZER_URL` on Render (important)

**Free tier (both services on Free):** use the analyzer’s **public URL**:

```text
https://finance-analyzer-jsoq.onrender.com
```

Render docs: *“Free web services can send private network requests, but they can't receive them.”*  
So internal host:port (`finance-analyzer-jsoq:10000`) **will not work** on free tier — you’ll see `ENOTFOUND` or “Analyzer not ready” with no `analyze-file` logs.

Set on **finance-api → Environment → `ANALYZER_URL`** (manual value, no trailing slash).

The app wakes the analyzer **from your browser** before upload (same as opening the URL manually). Server-to-server wake from finance-api often fails on free tier.

**Paid tier (analyzer on Starter+):** use internal host:port from **finance-analyzer → Connect → Internal** tab.

**Render dashboard checklist**

| Check | Where | Expected |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Two web services | Dashboard | `finance-api` **and** `finance-analyzer` |
| `ANALYZER_URL` on API | finance-api → Environment | **Free:** `https://finance-analyzer-….onrender.com` |
| Analyzer healthy | finance-analyzer → Logs | `Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:10000` |
| API log on start | finance-api → Logs | `Analyzer URL: https://finance-analyzer-…` (free tier) |
| Upload works | finance-analyzer → Logs | `analyze-file: '….xlsx'` and `POST /analyze-file` |

**First request after idle** may take ~60s (Render free tier cold start). Open the analyzer URL in a browser first to wake it, then upload.

---

## Step 3 — GitHub Pages (free)

1. Repo **Settings → Pages** → Source: **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = your Render API URL (no trailing slash)
3. Push to `main` — workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds and deploys.
4. Site URL: `https://YOUR_USER.github.io/Finance/` (or your repo name).

---

## Step 4 — Verify security

1. Open the Pages URL in a private window.
2. Click **Try demo** → sample data only, no upload.
3. Click **Sign in** with wrong password → rejected.
4. Sign in with `AUTH_PASSWORD` → your real months appear.
5. Open `https://YOUR_API.onrender.com/api/months` without a token → `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## Monthly workflow (production)

1. Export new `.xlsx` from Leumi.
2. Sign in on the deployed site.
3. **Upload statement** in the sidebar (Sync is local-only; production uses upload).

Review / mappings update Supabase automatically.

---

## Local dev (unchanged)

Leave `AUTH_PASSWORD` empty → no login required.

```bash
# terminal 1
uvicorn analyzer_api.main:app --port 8001

# terminal 2
cd api && npm run dev

# terminal 3
cd web && npm run dev
```

---

## Optional: two passwords

Instead of one shared password, set on Render:

```
AUTH_PASSWORDS=your-password,wife-password
```

(`AUTH_PASSWORD` still works if you only need one.)

---

## Keep data off GitHub

Personal data lives in **Supabase**, not in the repo. These paths are gitignored — do **not** force-add them:

- `data/statements.json`
- `data/merchant_rules.json`
- `data/review_progress.json`
- `data/fixed_charges.json`, `data/living_budget.json`, `data/excluded_transactions.json`
- `data/user_*.json` (local API cache when `STORAGE=local`)
- `data/cal_session.json`, `data/cal_credentials.json` (Cal sync session + login hints)
- `statements/*.xlsx`

If they were committed before, use a **private** repo or remove them from git history before going public.
